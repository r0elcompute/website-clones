#Website clones


Website clones is a repository that presents a rich portfolio of websites from different brands that I personally decided to clone.

The repository is an enlightenment I had to make progress for my front-end development journey using technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript which I haven't started to explore yet but plan to through these projects.
